# AI Compliance &amp; Policy Assistant (ACPA)

A platform that can help companies automatically understand, summarize, monitor, and enforce
compliance rules across legal documents, policies, contracts, and audit checklists.
Think of it as “ChatGPT + RAG + workflow engine for compliance,” where enterprises pay real money
because compliance is mandatory in finance, healthcare, HR, cyber-security, data protection.

## Problems it solves

* Companies struggle to keep up with changing regulations

   * RBI/SEBI rules 
   * GDPR/Data privacy updates 
   * SOX, PCI DSS, HIPAA 
   * Company-specific auditing requirements

* Teams waste hours reading documents manually
   Your AI will:

   * Read long PDFs
   * Extract key rules 
   * Compare with internal documents 
   * Highlight gaps 
   * Suggest compliance actions

* No system currently connects policies → teams → tasks → audits
   Your app becomes that missing workflow.
